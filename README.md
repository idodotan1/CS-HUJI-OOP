# CS-HUJI-OOP
These are the projects I completed during Semester A of 2025 as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Project Descriptions:
Project 1 – A basic tic-tac-toe game featuring different types of AI opponents, along with options to adjust the board size and the required streak to win.
Project 2 – A bricker game built using DanoGameLab, a platform developed by the university specifically for game development in the OOP course.
Project 3 – An ASCII-Art converter that transforms images into ASCII-based representations.
Project 4 – A simplified Terraria-style game, also developed using DanoGameLab.
Project 5 – A simplified Java syntax analyzer, which parses and validates code written in a restricted version of Java according to predefined rules.
Additional Notes:
As the course progressed, we learned more about OOP principles and design patterns. Consequently, in the earlier projects, we weren’t yet familiar with certain patterns that could have improved our implementations.
I also want to credit my partner Yonatan Scheffer, that besides Project 1 we worked on all the other projects together.
